WBash is a simple terminal app for Windows that allows you to use Linux commands and have a Linux-like UI without having to use wsl, instead you're still on your own Windows system

>[!IMPORTANT]
>WBash is still in a pre-alpha state meaning that it barely has and is still being updated to get it to the beta version
