</p>

**UnixMode** is a lightweight terminal application for Windows that enables you to use Linux commands seamlessly on your Windows system. UnixMode and WSL are 2 different tools as UnixMode allows the user to run Linux commands on the Windows enviromnet while WSL allows the user to create an entirely new Linux enviroment.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>UnixMode is still in a pre-alpha state meaning that it barely has and is still being updated to get it to the beta version
